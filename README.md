# JEST Learning Part 2

A small app to learn about snapshot testing straight from the team at Meta using this [documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react).

[A bit of trivia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jest_(framework)#:~:text=Jest%5B1%5D,a%20testing%20framework.>): Jest was built on top of Jasmine (a testing library I learned in LaunchCode but never applied in later projects).
